# NLP_projects

This page consists of the following projects:
-	Finite State Transducer which transduces the infinitive form of verbs to their correct -ing form and a sentence generation algorithm which generates sentences along with its probability using various smoothed and unsmoothed n- gram language models 
-	Context-free grammar and implementation of the CKY algorithm for parsing a sentence using probabilistic context-free grammar in NLTK 
-	Part of Speech tagging algorithm using Hidden Markov Model and Viterbi algorithms. 
-	IBM Model 1 for word alignment on a parallel corpus of movie subtitles to find the best alignment for a set of test sentence pairs.
